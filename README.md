# Ever Have a Conversation with Your Computer?
Imagine talking to a computer that can actually hold a conversation with you! That's the power of an end-to-end chatbot. These clever bots can handle a complete chat, from beginning to end, without needing human intervention.

Building one might seem complex, but it's like training a puppy (hopefully less messy!). You just need to collect data, choose the right tools (like programming languages and NLP magic), train the bot, and test it to make sure it understands you.

This repository showcases a simple Streamlit chatbot built with NLTK and scikit-learn. It can recognize basic user intents and respond accordingly.

# Features:
Classifies user input into predefined intents.

Provides pre-defined responses based on the intent.

Handles greetings, goodbyes, and basic questions.
